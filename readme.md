<h1>Design decision</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Nav bar button for current page deactivates for current page, to make it clear which page you are on from the nav bar.</li>
    <li>Logo (Aberdeen coat of arms) in nav bar so when you you enter the site on any page you will immediately know what the site is for.</li>
    <li>Nav bar switches from horizontal to vertical when screen size is smaller. Meaning the nav buttons don't get too small.</li>
    <li>The site has a simple layout that is very clear and easy to understand</li>
    <li>The background of the site is a very neutral colour that isn't too intrusive. All of the elements on the site have bold eye catching colours to contrast the background.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The indentation in the HTML threw me off a few times. It was also easier to follow on other IDEs</li>
    <li>I got muddled up with the styles and bootstrap a few times but managed to get through it after spending some time with the documentation</li>
</ul>
