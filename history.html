            <p>Aberdeen City, sometimes referred to as the Granite City, has been a settlement for roughly 8000 years. Aberdeen was once ruled by the English until Robert the Bruce liberated it during the wars of Scottish Independence in 1308. There have been many wars fought in Aberdeen. A notable war during 1644-1647, was the war of the three kingdoms, during which Aberdeen was taken by the royalist army. What proceeded was an outbreak of the bubonic plague which killed conservatively a quarter of Aberdeenâ€™s population.</p>
